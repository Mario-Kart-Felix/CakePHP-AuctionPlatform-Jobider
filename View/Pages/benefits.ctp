<!--<h1> What jobs are offered on Jobider?</h1>-->
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1995, 93% of the workforce in the U.S. was comprised of full-time and part-time employees managed by HR. This trend remained the same up to the early 2000’s.</p>

<p>Between 2009 and 2012, the number of temporary employees increased by 29%. A study of 200 largest companies in the U.S. found that, on average, 22% of their workforce were temporary workers and the number is steadily increasing.</p>

<p>Professionals from different industries are realizing that they can be productive outside of the office without having a long-term employer.</p>

<p>The steady growth of the freelancing community was also brought about by several factors such as the global economic downturn, improvements in technology, workers wanting to improve their “work life balance,” parents having difficulty or wary of placing their kids with child care providers and many other causes.</p>

<p>Take note however, that freelancing does not benefit just the freelancers. There are times when companies need to hire more people to do particular tasks. Although hiring extra staff and outsourcing to large businesses can help, freelancing is a good way to find fresh talent for tasks such as SEO, customer service, web design and a host of others.</p>

<h3 class="text_1">So, what are the benefits of hiring freelancers for your business?</h3>

<div class="question_top">
<h2>2.It is affordable</h2>
<p>Freelancers do not come with a lot of overhead costs. Freelancers simply provide you with a proposal for the work. They quote a price and you can negotiate. Once you accept, that’s the amount you pay. You don’t have to pay for insurance, health care, travel time, mailing, equipment, office furniture and other expenses. Same with hourly projects, you pay only for the freelancer’s hourly rate for hours he or she worked on the task you assigned them.</p>

<div class="question_top">
<h2>3.Hiring freelancers offers you more flexibility</h2>
<p>People go into freelancing because they don’t have to follow set office hours. Clients can also benefit from this flexibility. They can email their freelancers with a list of tasks at the end of the week and find all tasks finished by Monday. In fact, if you have a large project, you can hire freelancers from different time zones so that you have someone working 24/7.</p>

<div class="question_top">
<h2>4.Freelancers are independent</h2>
<p>Unlike new staff, freelancers are used to working on their own. Of course, you need to define what your expectations are and they will need to have access to information about your business but you won’t have sit with them through every task and explain everything in detail. You will be able to focus on other aspects of your business while your freelancer completes tasks that you assign.</p>

<div class="question_top">
<h2>5.Freelancers produce quality work</h2>
<p>When you hire freelancers, you have access to the freelancer’s work history, skills, client reviews, ratings and samples of previous work. You don’t have to rely on just a resumé and cover letter to gauge how a freelancer works.</p>
