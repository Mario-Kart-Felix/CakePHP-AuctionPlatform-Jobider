            <h2> Jobider Readiness Test for Freelancers and Staffing Managers </h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>  Jobider provides hundreds of free skill tests. When you pass an Jobider skills test, you highlight your skills to potential clients and make yourself more hireable. Take as many tests as you want—just make sure the test corresponds with the skills you want to present to potential clients. Don’t worry—there’s no penalty for failing a skills test, and it’s free to retake the test after 30 days. You can also hide any tests scores you do not like.</p>

            <h3>  The background  </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b> If you see a job post that you are interested in ,take the skills tests that correspond to the requested qualifications.</b>The client may not consider your application otherwise. After you take those tests, be sure your passing test score is public so clients can recognize you as a qualified candidate. </li>
                <li><b>Take tests featured on the profile of freelancers in your fileld.</b>Take a look at the applicants with public profiles on jobs, or do a search for freelancers to see the tests your competition has taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>     
                Although Jobider does not provide study guides, you can review an outline of the topics that will appear on our skills tests by looking at the basic syllabi provided for each test.

                You can also let us know after you finish the test by contacting Customer Support. We use these reports to improve the tests.</p>
